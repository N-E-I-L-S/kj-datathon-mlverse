    " increase in the prevalence of obesity in the U.S. remains under debate. Why are moreAmericans becoming obese despite ample public health information on the importance ofnutrition and exercise in maintaining a healthy body weight? Several economists contendthat technological change contributes signi ﬁcantly by simultaneously lowering the relative\n",
    " price of food and reducing the amount of physical activity required at work and in daily\n",
    " activity ( Philipson, 2001; Philipson and Posner, 1999; Lakdawalla and Philipson, 2002;\n",
    " Cutler et al., 2003 ).\n",
    " While agreeing that technological change is an important factor in the rise in obesity,\n",
    " Komlos et al. (2004) hypothesize that an increase in the rate of time preference also plays a\n",
    " key role. If people are less willing to trade current utility for potential future health bene ﬁts,\n",
    " then we expect they will consume more calorie dense foods and engage in more sedentaryleisure pursuits despite the future adverse consequences. This paper uses data on youngAmericans from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) to test the\n",

    " examine the data by gender, we ﬁnd evidence that higher time preference is associated with\n",

    " positively associated with body weight among black and Hispanic men and among blackwomen. The evidence also indicates that black men with higher time preference face ahigher probability of obesity.\n",
    " 1. Time preference\n",
    " Time preference is the rate at which people are willing to trade current bene ﬁt (utility)\n",
    " for future bene ﬁt and is often used in economics to explain savings and investment\n",
    " behavior. Having low time preference means a person is patient and has good self-control,i.e., s/he values the future. Having high time preference means a person much prefers\n",
    " satisfaction now (s/he is impatient, lacks self-control), and greatly discounts the future.\n",
    " Because weight control requires one to forego current consumption in order to gain futurepotential health bene ﬁts, the rate at which future bene ﬁts are discounted in ﬂuence current\n",
    " food consumption decisions. Laibson (1997) notes that ‘‘individuals who have this capacity\n",
    " [self control] are able to stay on diets, carry through on exercise regimens ...’’. Thus, weP.K. Smith et al. / Economics and Human Biology 3 (2005) 259 –270 260argue that a higher the rate of time preference will, ceteris paribus , lead to less investment in\n",
    " exercise and greater caloric intake, resulting in weight gain and an increased risk of obesity.\n",
    " The marginal rate of time preference ( s) measures the rate at which a person is willing to\n",
    " trade current utility for future utility. The intertemporal discount rate, 1/(1 + s), a measure\n",
    " of impatience, is used to calculate the present value of future utility. For example, a personwho values utility now the same as utility later has zero time preference ( s= 0). The\n",
    " discount rate is then 1 and future bene ﬁts are valued the same as current bene ﬁts. In\n",
    " contrast, the more a person prefers current satisfaction to future utility, the higher is the rate\n",
    " of time preference and the lower is the discount factor. In the extreme case, individuals are\n",
    " so impatient that they do not value future utility at all ( s=1), and the discount rate is 0.\n",
    " Thus, an increase in simplies that individuals value future utility less than they did in\n",
    " previous time periods.\n",
    " 1\n",
    " The signi ﬁcance of time preference in health outcomes has been recognized, but its\n",
    " connection speci ﬁcally to obesity has not yet been fully explored. According to Fuchs\n",
    " (1986, 1991) , differences in the rate of time preference can help explain variations in a\n",
    " number of health-related choices, such as smoking, diet, and exercise. Grossman (1972)\n",
    " does include the concept of time preference in a model of health choices; however, he doesnot explicitly estimate the impact of time preference on the demand for health. Ehrlich and\n",
    " Chuma (1990) predict that higher rates of time preference lead to lower demand for\n",
    " longevity and less investment in health, but they do not empirically test this aspect of theirtheory. One of the few to empirically test the role of time preference on health decisions isBishai (2001) . He reports evidence that lower rates of time preference are associated with\n",
    " lower alcohol consumption among adolescents.\n",
    " Researchers are beginning to consider the potential impact of time preference on\n",
    " nutrition and weight speci ﬁcally. Blaylock et al. (1999) assert that American dietary habits\n",
    " suffer despite extensive information on the relationship between health and nutritionbecause Americans discount the future heavily, but offer no empirical evidence. Levy\n",
    " (2002) presents a model of body weight that incorporates the rate of time preference and\n",
    " demonstrates theoretically that the utility maximizing equilibrium weight may exceed themedically optimal weight. Cutler et al. (2003) argue that the technologically driven\n",
    " decrease in food preparation time impacts those with higher time preference the most,\n",
    " exacerbating their self-control problems by speeding up the process of grati ﬁcation via\n",
    " food consumption. The authors note as evidence that the rise in weight has been largest atthe upper tail of the distribution.\n",
    " 2In contrast, Cutler and Glaeser (2005) argue that little of\n",
    " the variation in health behaviors, including obesity, can be explained by variations in timepreference and are instead largely due to variations in genetics and situational in ﬂuences.\n",
    " These authors report low correlations between various health related behaviors and theirP.K. Smith et al. / Economics and Human Biology 3 (2005) 259 –270 261\n",
    " 1For a review of the literature on time preference see Frederick, Loewenstein, and O ’Donoghue (2005) .\n",
    " 2In contrast, Becker and Mulligan (1997) reverse the relationship and argue that differences in health cause\n",
    " differences in the rate of time preference. Those with poor health do not expect to live as long, so making thesacri ﬁce of current utility in favor of future utility is less attractive. If obesity lowers life expectancy, the Becker-\n",
    " Mulligan theory would imply that its prevalence would raise the rate of time preference. Their empirical analysis\n",
    " focuses on testing the hypothesis that wealth causes patience (lower time preference), and does not directly\n",
    " examine whether time preference has an impact on health. Their model is, however, consistent with theobservation that richer women are less likely to be obese.regression analysis supports their argument. However, their empirical work is based largely\n",
    " on individuals over 45 years old and there are likely to be lifecycle effects on the timing ofbene ﬁts and harms from body size. Younger persons probably derive more immediate\n",
    " bene ﬁts from lower body weight in the marriage market while the middle aged would\n",
    " realize primarily deferred bene ﬁts to health and longevity.\n",
    " Psychologists have also investigated the role of time preference and related personality\n",
    " characteristics, such as conscientiousness, in health behavior ( Chapman et al., 2001 ). They\n",
    " note that studies of addictive behavior ﬁnd some evidence linking time preference to health\n",
    " choices. For example, Kirby et al., (1999) ﬁnd greater discounting among heroin addicts\n",
    " than among controls that did not use drugs. The evidence for smokers has been mixed,however.\n",
    " Mahon et al. (1997) report an association between an attitude they call ‘‘time\n",
    " perspective, ’’the perceived predictability of the future, and exercise and nutrition behavior.\n",
    " Friedman et al. (1995) ﬁnd a positive association between childhood conscientiousness and\n",
    " longevity in a panel study of gifted children. The authors attribute part of this connection to\n",
    " avoidance of tobacco and alcohol by the more conscientious. However, they ﬁnd no\n",
    " evidence that childhood conscientiousness correlates with adult body weight in theirsample.\n",
    " Komlos et al. (2004) use aggregate data to explore whether the hypothesized link\n",
    " between time preference and obesity is plausible. They use the U.S. savings rate andhousehold debt ratio as proxies for time preference; lower savings and greater debtsuggesting higher time preference. Since the late 1970s U.S. obesity rates and debt ratioshave been rising, and the savings rate has been falling. Correlation is, of course, not\n",
    " causality, but the trends at least suggest the hypothesized relationship is plausible. In\n",
    " addition, Zagorsky (2005) ﬁnds an inverse relationship between net worth and BMI, which\n",
    " is consistent with our hypothesis.\n",
    " Is there any reason to think that the marginal rate of time preference has increased?\n",
    " Blaylock et al., (1999) note that personal savings in America has fallen and that credit card\n",
    " debt has risen. Furthermore, the number of personal bankruptcies ﬁled in the U.S. has been\n",
    " steadily rising (Administrative Of ﬁce of the U.S. Courts). Parker (1999) documents the\n",
    " decline in personal savings since 1980, as well as the decline in private savings and the rise\n",
    " in personal consumption as a percent of GDP.\n",
    " 3He investigates the possible causes of rising\n",
    " consumption and reduced savings and concludes that the prime candidates are ‘‘factors that\n",
    " increase the effective discount rate ...(p. 32). ’’\n",
    " A rise in the discount rate may be related to technological advances, which have\n",
    " increased the speed of delivery of goods and services, and have thus raised our expectationsfor quick satisfaction. Advertising strategies and increased communication capabilitiesmay also contribute by encouraging immediate satisfaction. Lastly, perhaps the aging ofthe U.S. population leads to higher time preference, as a larger proportion of citizens\n",
    " perceive having less time left for enjoyment in the future as they near the end of their\n",
    " expected life spans ( Trostel and Taylor, 2001 ).P.K. Smith et al. / Economics and Human Biology 3 (2005) 259 –270 262\n",
    " 3‘‘Personal savings ’’refers to the income households do not spend. Private savings refers to savings by both\n",
    " households and ﬁrms: it is personal savings plus business retained earnings.2. Methodology\n",
    " The model presented in Komlos et al. (2004) predicts that time preference and body\n",
    " weight will be positively related; those who discount the future more highly are likely toover-consume calories. We test this model implication using the National LongitudinalSurvey of Youth (1979), a unique panel study of a nationally representative sample of\n",
    " American youth ( Zagorsky, 1997 ). All respondents were between 14 and 22 years old when\n",
    " theﬁrst survey was collected in 1979. The NLSY79 provides a wealth of data on\n",
    " respondents ’socioeconomic characteristics and labor market experiences. Information on\n",
    " self-reported height and weight was collected beginning in 1981, when the averagerespondent was 19.7-year-old ( Table 1 ).\n",
    " By 1989 the typical respondent was 28.1-year-old and the NLSY79 questionnaire began to\n",
    " include questions about savings. Respondents reported whether they had put more moneyinto savings than they had withdrawn (saved), withdrawn more money from savings than they\n",
    " had put in (dissaved), or if their savings had remained constant since the previous year. Our\n",
    " hypothesis is that persons with high time preference tend to spend rather than save, in order toobtain satisfaction now. Hence, respondents who report dissaving would have higher timepreference than those who report positive savings. Thus, we use the savings and dissavingsinformation to proxy time preference.\n",
    " 4Table 1 shows that nearly 30% of respondents\n",

    " 5Because of the complex design of the NLSY survey, all descriptive analyses must use weighted data\n",

    " Table 2 presents the OLS regression estimation of BMI for men and women in 1989\n",
    " using unweighted data. As predicted, women with higher family incomes have loweraverage BMIs. Furthermore, blacks and Hispanics have higher BMIs than whites. Theresults also indicate that men who dissave or have no change in savings have higher average\n",

    " no savings is positively associated with BMI, which also lends some support to ourhypothesis. Serious collinearity exists between age and age-squared, but does not affect theestimated coef ﬁcients on the remaining regressors.\n",
    " Regressions for each gender-ethnicity group indicate that among black and Hispanic\n",
    " men, the predicted association between the time preference proxies and BMI does exist(Tables 3 and 4 ). Among women, the evidence suggests a positive association between\n",

    " regressions using the same set of independent variables, but with a dependent variableequal to 1 if the respondent is obese (BMI /C2130) and equal to 0 otherwise. Among men, we\n",
    " ﬁnd that the association between ‘‘Dissaved ’’and the probability of obesity is statistically\n",

    " blacks ( Table 6 ). None of three logistic regressions for women produce evidence\n",
    " supporting the time preference hypothesis ( Table 7 ).\n",
    " 4. Conclusions\n",
    " We examine the hypothesis that time preference is positively associated with BMI using\n",
    " individual data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. If the hypothesis is\n",
    " accepted, increases in time preference could help explain the obesity epidemic in the U.S.\n",
    " With all ethnic groups aggregated, we ﬁnd evidence that in 1989 our proxies for higher time\n",
    " preference are associated with greater BMI among men, and to a lesser extent amongwomen. Analysis disaggregated by ethnicity and gender suggests that time preference ispositively associated with BMI among black and Hispanic men, as well as among blackwomen. We also ﬁnd that our proxy for higher time preference is associated with an\n",
    " elevated risk of obesity among black men.\n",
    " These results rely on the assumption that the savings data are good proxies for time\n",
    " preference. The proxies likely do not measure only ‘‘pure’’time preference, risk preference\n",
    " and interest rate effects may be included. It is also possible that ‘‘constant or no savings, ’’\n",
    " and perhaps ‘‘dissaving, ’’may represent expenditures on health care, health club\n",
    " memberships and the like. However, our analysis, as well as the national trends foroverweight and obesity, does not support this notion. Dissavings could also represent astressful shock that might lead to depression and its attendant disturbances in eatingbehavior. One would not, however, venture to explain the obesity epidemic around theworld on the basis of clinical depression, whereas there could possibly be global trends\n",
    " leading to more immediate grati ﬁcation and higher time preference.\n",
    " Ethnic differences in the effect of time preference on BMI and obesity may relate to\n",
    " varying cultural beliefs and attitudes about body image and body fatness. Several studiesreport that blacks and Hispanics tolerate, and may even encourage, larger body size than dowhites. Becker et al. (1999) performed a street survey of 927 black and white adults in a\n",
    " large American city. Participants were asked their height and weight and to select fromstandardized silhouette images their current body size, their ideal self-image, and theirideal image for the opposite sex. The authors report that, ‘‘Multiple regression analysis\n",
    " showed that, independent of sociodemographic variables and co-morbidity, body image\n",
    " sizes for current self, ideal self, and ideal for the opposite sex were all signi ﬁcantly greater\n",
    " in African-Americans. ’’\n",
    " A study of 103 college men and non-college community men examined preferences for\n",
    " body size of women ( Freedman et al., 2004 ). The investigators found that black men wereP.K. Smith et al. / Economics and Human Biology 3 (2005) 259 –270 267more likely to choose images of heavier women than is the case for white men. There were\n",
    " no differences between college men and non-college men from the community. The blackmen also preferred women with very low waist-to-hip ratios, in this case meaning womenwith relatively heavier hips and buttocks, than did the white men. Freedmen et al. suggestthat these male preferences may permit black women to gain more weight without theassociated pathology of body image and eating disorders that are more often found in whitewomen. A more recent report by Gipson et al. (2005) alsoﬁnds that black women attending\n",
    " an historically black university in the U.S. tolerate a variety of body sizes, including\n",
    " overweight and obese sizes, as assessed by their selection of body size silhouette images.\n",
    " Sanchez-Johnsen et al. (2004) investigated correlates of obesity in Latin-American\n",
    " (n= 234) and black women ( n= 271), aged 18 –67-year-old, who all participated in an\n",
    " obesity prevention trial. Both groups of women were, on average, overweight or obese asmeasured by BMI, but the black women were signi ﬁcantly more obese (mean BMIs of 31.4\n",
    " for blacks versus 29.6 for Latin-Americans). The Latin-American women reported morebody image dissatisfaction than did the black women, and the authors believe this mayaccount for the lower average BMI score of the Latin-Americans.\n",
    " It is also likely that there are complex interactions between gender, ethnicity, income,\n",
    " education, family medical history, and other biosocial variables that in ﬂuence the\n",
    " construction of time preference and health behavior of individuals ( Zhang and Wang,\n",
    " 2004 ). A prospective, multifactorial study and improved measures of time preference\n",
    " would provide a better understanding of the role of time preference in the risk foroverweight and obesity. Even so, given the current epidemic of overweight and obesity inthe United States, and the associated costs (private and pubic), it seems prudent to ﬁnd\n",
    " ways to encourage people to lower their time preference and place more value on their\n",
